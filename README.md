2. Chibi Characters Representing Weather
Chibi characters (small, cute versions of characters) can be used to represent different weather conditions. For example:

Sunny Weather: A happy chibi character with sunglasses, holding a cold drink, or wearing a sun hat. and walking animation
Rainy Weather: A chibi character holding an umbrella or wearing a raincoat, jumping in puddles.
Cloudy Weather: A relaxed character lounging in the clouds, with soft, fluffy hair. 
Snowy Weather: A character bundled up in a cute winter coat, maybe throwing snowballs.
These characters could change depending on the weather forecast!
and then for wind we could also have some animation

I was thinking something like my love story with yamada kun and names

Aoi-chan (青いちゃん) – "Aoi" means blue, as in the clear blue sky on a sunny day.
Ame-chan (雨ちゃん) – "Ame" means rain.
Kumo-chan (雲ちゃん) – "Kumo" means cloud.
Kaze-chan (風ちゃん) – "Kaze" means wind.
Yuki-chan (雪ちゃん) – "Yuki" means snow.
Kaminari-chan (雷ちゃん) – "Kaminari" means thunder

then tech stack:

frontend: React, Vite, possible something else lol
backend: Tauri, OpenWeatherMap API

do npm run dev in one terminal and npm run tauri dev in anotherboth cd to frontend
